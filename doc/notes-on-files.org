Notes on files in BlueZen

* clib is a 65c265-based version of lib65816, with some extras.
* bridge.c: old main.c from bsx, implements required functions for lib65816. 
  *note* SDL event handling happens in the EMUL_hardwareUpdate() function.
* video.c/video.h
  video.h: included by bridge.c and video.c, declares functions in video.c.
  video.c: SDL emulation of VERA plus SDL handler for keyboard & mouse.
* glue.c/glue.h
  glue.h: only included by video.c, declares support functions needed by video.c
    - also defines some external variables video.c needs:
      extern bool grab_mouse;
      extern bool warp_mode;
      extern uint8_t activity_led;
      extern bool disable_emu_cmd_keys;
      extern bool enable_midline;
      extern uint8_t machine_mhz;
      extern bool log_video;
  glue.c: mostly do-nothing implmentations of functions needed by video.c

* *note* really should look over video.c/glue.c 
  -> eliminate X16-isms that we don't need.
