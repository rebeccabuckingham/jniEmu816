#+TITLE: jniEmu816 Work to do.

* DONE Update code to load the S65X Kernel ROM.
* TODO [A] Update vectors / irq logic based on 265.org.
* TODO [B] Changes to make to bring VERA into the emulator:
** DONE [A] Remove all Swing components from jniEmu816
    - console, etc.
** DONE [C] Bring VERA in from bexemu:
    - add all C files from vera
    - make sure gradle builds the library and properly includes vera
    - otherwise should just work
** TODO [B] Changes to bridge.h / bridge.c:
*** new: memory_allocate(name, start_address, length)
    - for emulated RAM/ROM
    - need a linked list with RAM/ROM objects.
    - needs to be exposed to the Java side.
*** EMUL_hardwareUpdate()
    - call vera update (60 hz)
    - do other hardware updates
    - check for control signals from Java
*** MEM_readMem() & MEM_writeMem()
    - read/write calls in VERA's address space have to go directly to VERA.
    - RAM/ROM needs to be specified on the C side, not Java, so RAM/ROM is fast.
    - read/write calls outside of VERA & RAM/ROM get delegated to the java side.
* TODO [C] Create debugging interface via Socket
** TODO Functionality
  - connect to port 6502 to control the emulator.
  - want the ability to pause the emulator until debugger is connected.
  - control of the debugger: Swing GUI or Command line-ish?
* TODO [D] Change name of the project from jniEmu816 to emuS65X.
