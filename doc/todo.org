* TODO rename lib65816 library and directory
  - we're combining lib65816 functionality with custom stuff, so it's a misnomer now.
    -> build.gradle
    -> Main.java

* TODO really think through the whole VERA thing before going down that path.
  - there's a lot of X16-degunking that would need to be done.
  - could always use libgdx to make something else.

* Update lib65816 with non-65c265 changes from bsx.
** TODO Create a TCP/IP based ConsoleDevice
  - need an option to specify the port, maybe default to 6510.
  - need an option to wait for connection before starting CPU.
** TODO MEM_readMem() and MEM_writeMem() should use *local* memory 
  - video memory accesses stay in C land.
  - java-provided peripherals will need to register with the C
    library to be put in an exception list.
** TODO Port video code from bsx emulator.
** TODO Need to handle runAddress.  
  - Should default to reset vector unless specified on command line.
** DONE Allow multiple files to be loaded at the command line.
** TODO Also create a TCP/IP based debugger.
  - same options as ConsoleDevice.
  - default port 6511.
